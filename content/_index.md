        - Our family cabin in Sylvan Lake needed a master bedroom and bathroom facelift. The cabin renovation required a contractor that could work professionally without supervision as I live in Calgary. We relied on Nicole and Matt to do the floor design and to do the interior design of the upgrade to match the look and feel of the current cabin. 
        - Once the floor plan and interior design, along with the budget was approved MM Custom Contracting started the process of ripping out the old and building the new. Matt worked continuously on the project with Nicole till the work was completed. 
        - The project was on time, on budget and spectacular. 
        - I would highly recommend anyone to use MM Custom Contracting for any home renovation. 
        - Thanks,

        - Matt did a bath renovation for us in the summer of 2018. We had interviewed several contractors but Matt seemed the most confident and understanding of my needs and timeline. He also was one of the only contractors who were willing to change the bathroom layout. Everyone else was nervous because of the infloor heat. Matt carefully (by hand) chiseled the bathroom floor out so that I could move my bathtub, toilet and shower with no impact to our existing infloor heat.  Matt was patient with me as I constantly changed my bathroom layout and he patiently explained every other day why I couldn't do what I wanted and never seemed exhausted by my new ideas. Over the course of the couple weeks he was working with us, Matt became like family, it was fun to have him around.  Matt is also one of the only contractors we have had (and we have had a lot) who took great lengths to protect our existing floors and kept an extremely clean work space. We enjoyed working with Matt and would recommend that you consider him for your future renovations.
        - Thank you!

        - We hired MM Custom to re-do a shower install that was completed by another contractor only a few years earlier but was breaking down and causing water damage. Matt found the root cause and remediated all the damage. MM Custom was very open and upfront about all costs associated with the project, including the increased costs associated with the water damage found, ensuring we were not shocked when we received our invoice.
        - MM Custom brought in a few tile options for us to select our design, which were all in our aesthetic. The tile work on our new shower is impeccable, especially considering they had to work with the un-level ceiling in our 100 year old home. Matt offered options to upgrade where he thought it might be of value but did not push anything on us. He also reused material (the shower door) where it made sense to do so. The project was completed quickly and looks beautiful. Our shower is finally level and we have had no water problems since it was installed. We would happily hire MM Custom for any future projects and would recommend them to anyone looking to complete a renovation.
